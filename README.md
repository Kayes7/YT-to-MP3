# YT-to-MP3
A python program that  I have created to download music audio from YT.
Well, as I'm beggining using python I wanted to do some practical program,
so I decided to create the python version of many webs that do this 'YT to Mp3'.

Giving a name of a song and the artist, It will search in youtube, take the first 5 videos (default) and download the best optiop for audio.
What I mean by 'best option' is a intend to dowload a video that only have the song audio (not opening video sounds or something like that).
It's really basic how I do it, cause of that sometimes it will download just the most relevant option.

As you may see, It's functional. However, probably there are more efficient ways of 
creating this functions... Therefore, if anyone have some idea or suggestion to make, pls comment it.

:D
